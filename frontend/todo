* check on type-safeness of file:any in Database.ts
* maybe fix weird race condition bug with A->B->C where moving C into A sometimes leaves a blank space below C
* if possible, define styles externally so that we have one source of truth for both tailwind.config.cjs & index.scss
* fix the flash of loading screen on opening a modal that loads quickly - also, let "loading..." appear on top of the modal for a moment after load, it looks nice
* you know you're gonna have to do it anyway so just do it - make thumbnails for images
* Eventually: put in easter eggs for achievements
* truncate long names in the middle
* for the breadcrumb:
  * calculate the longest path that can be displayed without truncationg & display it
  * everything else, compile into an ellipsis in the breadcrumb base with a dropdown menu
* the dropdown menu for the upload button doesn't go away when opening a context menu, but the UserMenu button does - what's up with that?
