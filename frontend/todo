- check on type-safeness of file:any in Database.ts
- maybe fix weird race condition bug with A->B->C where moving C into A sometimes leaves a blank space below C
- if possible, define styles externally so that we have one source of truth for both tailwind.config.cjs & index.scss
- fix the flash of loading screen on opening a modal that loads quickly - also, let "loading..." appear on top of the modal for a moment after load, it looks nice
